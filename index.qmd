### Profile

Currently, I am working on the silicon microstrip detector for the Compressed Baryonic Matter(CBM) experiment. 
My work involves the optical inspection of the silicon sensor and the characterization of the sensor. 
Further, I am doing the image processing of the silicon sensor which helps us to know and locate defects on sensor's surface such as implant break, open passivation, dust, damaged ac/dc pad etc.

I specialize in transforming complex datasets into **reliable, actionable insights** through
well-engineered workflows, developed within international collaborations such as **CBM/FAIR,
GSI Helmholtz Centre**, and **Goethe University Frankfurt**.


### Research & Data Analytics Expertise

- ROOT/TGeo-based simulation geometry development for the Silicon Tracking System (STS)  
- Comparative studies: Primitive solids vs. Tessellated/CAD-derived geometry (runtime, secondaries, physics impact).  
- Tracking-performance evaluation: Efficiency, Acceptance, Momentum resolution.  
- Data rate studies in the 4-12 AGeV/c beam-momentum range for readout electronics Front-end-Boards (FEBs) assignment to the detector.  
- Reproducible workflows, **CMake-based builds**, CI/CD, and automated testing  
- STS physics simulations including hits reconstruction efficiency (dead-time / electronic threshold dependence), cluster characterization, and dE/dx.

### Software Skills

- **C++** 
- **Python** 
- **CERN-ROOT** 
- **GEANT4** 
- **Git** 

### Operating System
- **Linux** 
- **Windows**


### What I Work On

- Designing reliable data analysis pipelines for large and complex datasets  
- Validating simulations and experimental data through statistical analysis  
- Building maintainable scientific software used by distributed research teams  
- Applying physics-informed data analysis techniques to real-world problems

**Tech stack:** Python · SQL · C++ · Git · Linux · ROOT · CMake · CI/CD
